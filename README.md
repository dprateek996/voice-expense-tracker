# Voice Expense Tracker — India-ready

A fast, modern, voice-powered expense tracker built with a full-stack JavaScript setup. Users can log expenses by speaking or typing, and the system automatically parses, cleans, and categorizes the input using Gemini AI.

The goal: make expense tracking effortless, quick, and natural.
